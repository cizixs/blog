## Quick Start

Use jekyll to write posts is as easy as play Fruit Ninja, there is barely learning process.
To create a new post:

    rake post title="post title"

It will automatically create a post under _post folder with format 'date-title.md'.

To create a new page:

    rake page name='page name'

You can specify the path of the page, like /about.md, pages/about.md.
